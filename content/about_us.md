# Meet the Crew

## A One-Person Adventure (For Now)

<p>
Cocolabs is currently a pet project led by just one person—me! This initiative is designed with the vision to grow and evolve over time.  
It’s an open-source project aimed at supporting Mac admins by providing better tools 🛠️ and raw information 📊 to make their jobs easier and more efficient.  
While it’s a solo endeavor for now, there’s plenty of room for expansion, collaboration 🤝, and community involvement in the future.

    Hi, I’m Cody—a Mac admin at NIWC Atlantic 🖥️ with a deep-rooted passion for technology and problem-solving. Over the years, I’ve gained invaluable experience working in diverse environments, including higher education 🎓, local and federal government 🏛️, and high-compliance sectors 🔒. I take pride in leveraging my expertise to streamline workflows, manage complex systems, and contribute to open-source projects that benefit the wider community 🌍.  
  </p>
  <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
    Outside of work, I’m a dedicated gamer 🎮 who thrives on strategy and collaboration, a proud Hawaiian 🌺 who values community and culture, and an enthusiastic dog lover 🐶. I’m also passionate about contributing to open-source initiatives 💻, empowering others in the tech world to work smarter and more efficiently. When I’m not coding or gaming, you can often find me enjoying the vibrant life of Charleston, SC 🌴, where I call home.
